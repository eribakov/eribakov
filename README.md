## Hi there, I'm Emili! 👋

I'm a second-year **Computing** student at **Queen's University**, specializing in **Math & Analytics**.

I'm passionate about building real-world web applications that solve meaningful problems. As a **front-end developer @ QWeb**, I work with React, Next.js, and TypeScript to create interactive, user-focused experiences.

I love learning about the intersection of mathematics, algorithms, and modern development.
